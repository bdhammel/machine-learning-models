# Basic machine learning models for reference

Algorithms benchmarked to the MNIST dataset

## Principle Component Analysis (PCA)

Notes: 

## Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

Simple fully-connected network

MNIST accuracy: 96%

## Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

Simple fully-connected network

MNIST accuracy: 98%

Notes: Slow, only ran for 2 epoch. 

## Convolutional Neural Network (VGG16)

Implementation of the VGG16 architecture with pretrained MNIST data

MNIST accuracy: 

Notes: 

## Stacked Autoencoder (Xwing AE)

A symmetric autoencoder for unsupervised learning 

Notes: Success is largely dependent on layer sizes, seems to have a small window of convergence

## Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE)

A symmetric convolutional autoencoder
